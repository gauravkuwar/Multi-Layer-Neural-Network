# Multi-Layer Neural Network from Scratch

Even after taking multiple courses on Neural Networks, it was still difficult for me to grasp why they work and how they work. However, after taking the _Applied Mathematical Computation_ course at my University, and implementing various mathematical concepts in Python code, I realized that I best learn by doing and implementing.

Thus, I decided to implement a Neural Network from scratch only purely Python and NumPy (which is just used to speed up the matrix computations). I was also really inspired by this awesome youtube video: [Building a neural network FROM SCRATCH](https://youtu.be/w8yWXqWQYmU). I used the MNIST dataset because simple, works well, and is used by many to get started with Neural Networks. 

A lot of time went into understanding the math behind Neural Networks, especially the Calculus of stochastic gradient descent. But, this was an awesome learning experience and gives meaning to what we are doing when we tune hyper-parameters. 

Neural Networks are essentially simplified just models of the human brain and it feels like interacting with alien technology, and that's just really cool! 

In the end, I was able to get a very good accuracy of __97.05%__ !
